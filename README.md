# NDS-Lite-Emulation
This project focuses on the emulation of the Nintendo DS Lite handheld hardware

Firstly I plan to add an insightful video montage of the steps I took to teardown the NDS Lite,
 If I can't upload the videos I'll use pictures with descriptions instead.

I did use a guide I found on Youtube to help me with this so I will add that source here as well.
