# NDS-Lite-Emulation
This project focuses on the emulation of the Nintendo DS Lite handheld hardware

Firstly I plan to add an insightful video montage of the steps I took to teardown the NDS Lite,
 If I can't upload the videos I'll use pictures with descriptions instead.

I did use a guide I found on Youtube to help me with this so I will add that source here as well.

Now that I have caught up on the NDS Lite Emulation project videos by adding the Teardown steps and
 cable extension tests the next section will be focused on understanding the top screen communication interface.
 This will require a logic analyzer.
